# YFinance4s

Effectful Yahoo Finance client in the Scala programming language.

## Features

- **Historical Data**: OHLCV price data with configurable intervals and date ranges
- **Corporate Actions**: Dividend and stock split history
- **Price Repair**: Opt-in detection and repair of Yahoo's currency-unit errors (sporadic 100x bars and systematic unit switches) on daily and intraday charts
- **International Currency**: Opt-in standardisation of subunit-quoted markets (pence, cents, agora, fils) to their major unit, plus FX conversion of dividends paid in another currency
- **Options Data**: Option chains, expirations, and contract details (calls, puts, strikes, Greeks)
- **Stock Fundamentals**: Company data including financials, valuation ratios, and key statistics
- **Holders Data**: Institutional ownership, mutual fund holdings, and insider transactions
- **Financial Statements**: Income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements (annual, quarterly, trailing)
- **Analyst Data**: Price targets, recommendations, earnings estimates, upgrade/downgrade history, growth comparisons
- **Sector Data**: Sector overview, top ETFs, mutual funds, industries, and top companies for all 11 GICS sectors
- **Industry Data**: Per-industry overview, top companies, top performers (YTD return, implied upside), and top growth companies
- **Market Data**: Region-level market summary (headline indices), trading status with open/close times, and trending tickers
- **Earnings Calendar**: Market-wide upcoming earnings ranked by market cap, and per-ticker historical/upcoming earnings timelines
- **Search**: Ticker/company/news search with fuzzy matching
- **Stock Screener**: Custom and predefined equity/fund screens
- **ISIN Lookup**: Resolve ISINs to Yahoo Finance tickers with ISO 6166 validation
- **Batch Operations**: Parallel multi-ticker fetches with configurable concurrency and error-tolerant modes
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in outbound request pacing (interval-based, configurable, on by default) to avoid Yahoo throttling
- **Purely Functional**: Built on Cats Effect 3 with `Resource`-based lifecycle management
- **Cross-Platform**: JVM and Scala.js
- **Scala 2.13 & Scala 3**

## Installation

Published to Maven Central for Scala 2.13 and Scala 3:

```scala
// JVM
libraryDependencies += "io.github.coinductive" %% "yfinance4s" % "0.2.0"

// Scala.js
libraryDependencies += "io.github.coinductive" %%% "yfinance4s" % "0.2.0"
```

## Quick Start

```scala
import cats.effect._
import io.github.coinductive.yfinance4s._
import io.github.coinductive.yfinance4s.models._
import scala.concurrent.duration._

val config = YFinanceClientConfig(
  connectTimeout = 10.seconds,
  readTimeout = 30.seconds,
  retries = 3
)

YFinanceClient.resource[IO](config).use { client =>
  for {
    chart   <- client.charts.getChart(Ticker("AAPL"), Interval.`1Day`, Range.`1Year`)
    stock   <- client.charts.getStock(Ticker("AAPL"))
    targets <- client.analysts.getAnalystPriceTargets(Ticker("AAPL"))
    sector  <- client.sectors.getSectorData(SectorKey.Technology)
  } yield {
    chart.foreach(c => println(s"${c.quotes.size} data points"))
    stock.foreach(s => println(s"${s.longName}: ${s.regularMarketPrice}"))
    targets.foreach(t => println(s"Target: ${t.targetMean} (${t.numberOfAnalysts} analysts)"))
    sector.foreach(s => println(s"${s.name}: ${s.industryCount} industries"))
  }
}
```

## Price Repair

Yahoo occasionally reports bars in the wrong currency subunit (e.g. pence instead of pounds - exactly 100x off). Opt in per call to detect and fix these:

```scala
client.charts.getChart(Ticker("VOD.L"), Interval.`1Day`, Range.`5Years`, repair = PriceRepairConfig.Enabled)
```

Repaired bars carry `repaired = true` on their quotes; repair is best-effort and never fails the request. See `PriceRepairConfig` for semantics.

The same opt-in also standardises subunit-quoted international charts - a London chart in pence comes back in pounds, with `chart.currency` reporting `"GBP"` - and converts dividends Yahoo labels in another currency. `ChartResult.currency` always reports the chart's trading currency, standardised or not.
